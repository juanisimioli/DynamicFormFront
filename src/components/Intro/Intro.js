      <h1>DYNAMIC FORM</h1>
      <p>
        {`<DynamicForm />`} is a component that receives an array of fields and
        generates automatically a complete and functional form. <br />
        Made with React JS and hooks like useReducer and useContext to manage a
        global state for each form. <br />
        Backend is an AWS Lambda function made with Node JS that receives the
        formData and sends it through an email (NodeMailer). <br />
        You can choose a theme between 'light' or 'dark'. <br />
        Front End React App was deployed to AWS Amplify.
