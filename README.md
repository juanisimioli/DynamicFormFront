# DYNAMIC FORM

DynamicForm is a component that receives an array of fields, and generates automatically a complete and functional form.
Made with React JS and hooks like useReducer and useContext to manage a global state for each form.
Backend is an AWS Lambda function made with Node JS that receives the formData and sends it through an email (uses with NodeMailer).
You can choose a theme between 'light' or 'dark'.

## 

(!) As this is a work in progress app, you will see that the file you send through the form, arrives broken to your email. 
I'm looking into why using lambda functions does not work (same code running locally works fine!).

All the code from this application was made by Juan Ignacio Simioli.
